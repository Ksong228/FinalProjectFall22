# 2G
---
2G stands for **Second Generation** mobile network. 2G was officially introduced in 1991 after 1G was superseded by it. 2G mobile network ran on digital signal, not analogue, which greatly improved its security and capacity. On 2G, users could send SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) messages, but slowly as it is still new at that time and often without success. When GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) was introduced in 1997, users could receive and send emails on the move.
