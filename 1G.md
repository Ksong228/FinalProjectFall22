1G stands for **First Generation** mobile network. On 1G, users could only make phone calls and they couldn't send or receive text messages because they were reliant upon analogue radio systems. 1G mobile network was first introduced in Japan in 1979 before it was also used in other countries such as the U.S. in 1980. In order for it to work, cell towers were built around the country, which meant that signal coverage could be obtained from longer distances. The downside is that the network was unreliable and had some security issues as well, such as cell coverage would drop frequently. Also, it could be easily hacked, meaning that conversations could be easily heard and recorded. 1G remained until 1991.
