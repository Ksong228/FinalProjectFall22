# 3G
---
3G stands for **Third Generation** mobile network. 3G mobile networks are still in use today for some providers, but will shutdown/discontinue very soon, such as *Verizon* announced that they will discontinue its 3G network at the end of 2022. In comparison, to 2G, 3G was much faster and could transmit larger amounts of data. This means that users could share files, video call, watch TV online, browse the internet and play online games on their mobiles for the first time. Under 3G, cell phones were no longer just about texting and calling, they were the hub of social connectivity.
